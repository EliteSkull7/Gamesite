  <h2>Welcome to my Gamesite</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Shranjay Watts, and I’m currently pursuing the ISSE course at Ritsumeikan University. Gaming has been my biggest passion for as long as I can remember. I’ve played hundreds of PC games across nearly every genre from fast-paced shooters and immersive RPGs to strategy, horror, and puzzle games. While I enjoy exploring all types of games, open-world titles are my favorite. There’s something uniquely satisfying about the freedom to explore vast, dynamic environments, uncover hidden stories, and shape your own journey.
</p>
<p>
Among the many games I’ve played, Destiny 2 stands out as a long-time favorite. It’s a sci-fi multiplayer shooter by Bungie that I’ve been playing since 2019. I love its blend of action, lore, and cooperative gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I’m diving into the world of Pokémon games, which offer a refreshing mix of exploration, collection, and strategy. I also have a deep appreciation for horror games titles that challenge your nerves and immerse you in eerie, suspenseful atmospheres. Whether it’s surviving haunted houses or escaping supernatural threats, horror games keep me engaged with their storytelling and tension. Gaming isn’t just a hobby for me, it’s a way to experience countless worlds and narratives.
